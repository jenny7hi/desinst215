                <p style="font-size: 14px">(1) At first glance, San Joaquin county, home to California’s lowest expected confidence in drinking water at ~80% appears to actually have fairly safe tap access, with only 1.62% of the county’s 726,106 residents served by a system with a reportable water quality violation. However, water quality in the Central Valley including San Joaquin county, has been a growing area of concern for residents, given the region’s high risk of agricultural contamination (tellingly, 22 of San Joaquin County’s reported 57 violations concerned nitrate levels, a contaminant linked to use of chemical fertilizers). High rates of naturally-occuring arsenic also affect both public water systems, and the 10% of San Joaquin residents who use private wells. Neighboring Stanislaus County’s high rate of violations (21.74% affected) also reflects the regions’ difficulties with water supply, and may contribute to lack of trust among San Joaquin county residents. Given the elevated likelihood that residents may not trust their tap water, as well as the potential for problems, water systems in this area should invest in extra monitoring and testing, clearly communicating the results to residents to both alleviate concern and reduce the risk that residents take on the financial burden of purchasing bottled water, and to ensure that all actual quality violations are identified and remedied as quickly as possible.

                <p style="font-size: 14px">(2) On the other side, our demographic predictive model indicates residents of Santa Clara, Amador and Madera counties are likely to trust their tap water. However, more than 50% of residents in all 3 counties are served by water systems with at least one reportable quality violation in 2017. Therefore, water systems and public regulators in these areas should be particularly careful to communicate violations to their populations, and make sure all residents understand when the tap water should not be drunk, or what processing is necessary. </p>

                        <h3>How can we address perception?</h3>
                        <p>The question addressing perception of water quality was asked once as a rotating question in the American Housing Survey, and is our only concrete hint as to what people are feeling about their water quality. More often than not, we don’t have this data. But, once again, it’s an important piece of data to monitor. One proxy through which cities can do so is search popularity.</p>
                        <img src="graphics/searches.png" class="graphic">
                        <p>This chart maps search popularity of water quality related terms, such as “water quality,” “drinking water,” and “water purification,” (from Google Trends) to our safety perception percentages for fourteen metro areas that cover California. The higher proportion of all searches a term takes up, the higher search popularity score it has. All counties fall within one of the metro areas.</p>
                        <p>Excluding the three metro areas on the left side of the chart (Medford-Klamath Falls, Reno, and El Centro), the more people search for water quality related terms, the more trust they have in their water quality. As for the three outliers, they are the metro areas with the lowest populations, and may be more heavily populated by rural residents, who tend to be more knowledgeable about their water and therefore have greater trust in their water quality.</p>
                        <p>Cities can use this search popularity information to monitor how their residents perceive the quality of their water. Depending on whether or not that perception matches with the reality of the situation, they can then decide how to modify or improve related communication to address the discrepancy.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>When asked about why he thinks his water is safe to drink, one of our interviewees was at a loss for words. He didn’t know. “Not having this information seems a little funny.” Currently, perception and reality don’t seem to match up, and this is often the fault of poor communication. It will never hurt to have increased trust, transparency, and knowledge about water quality, and tackling perception -- or the inaccuracy of it -- is the first step. </p>
