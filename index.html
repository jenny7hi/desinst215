                        <p>Chances are, you don’t know where your water comes from. Yet, you probably have an opinion about the quality of your water — maybe everybody else around you drinks tap water, so you assume it’s safe, or maybe it’s common knowledge that you shouldn’t be drinking the tap water, or maybe you know there’s a risk drinking from the tap, but you haven’t died yet, so you might as well continue to do so. </p>
                        <p>Public perception of tap water quality is crucial for public water suppliers and policymakers, for reasons we’ll get into later. But does this perception reliably map to true water quality? Not always. One 2017 study conducted in Canada found that there was no association between perception of water quality and actual drinking water quality (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935117312653" target="_blank">Ochoo</a>) —  but in California, perception<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> and reality<sup><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup> seem to almost be inversely associated.

                <p style="font-size: 14px">At first glance, San Joaquin county, home to California’s lowest expected confidence in drinking water at ~80% appears to actually have fairly safe tap access, with only 1.62% of the county’s 726,106 residents served by a system with a reportable water quality violation. However, water quality in the Central Valley including San Joaquin county, has been a growing area of concern for residents, given the region’s high risk of agricultural contamination (tellingly, 22 of San Joaquin County’s reported 57 violations concerned nitrate levels, a contaminant linked to use of chemical fertilizers). High rates of naturally-occuring arsenic also affect both public water systems, and the 10% of San Joaquin residents who use private wells. Neighboring Stanislaus County’s high rate of violations (21.74% affected) also reflects the regions’ difficulties with water supply, and may contribute to lack of trust among San Joaquin county residents. Given the elevated likelihood that residents may not trust their tap water, as well as the potential for problems, water systems in this area should invest in extra monitoring and testing, clearly communicating the results to residents to both alleviate concern and reduce the risk that residents take on the financial burden of purchasing bottled water, and to ensure that all actual quality violations are identified and remedied as quickly as possible.

                <p style="font-size: 14px">On the other side, our demographic predictive model indicates residents of Santa Clara, Amador and Madera counties are likely to trust their tap water. However, more than 50% of residents in all 3 counties are served by water systems with at least one reportable quality violation in 2017. Therefore, water systems and public regulators in these areas should be particularly careful to communicate violations to their populations, and make sure all residents understand when the tap water should not be drunk, or what processing is necessary. </p>

                        <h3>Why does perception matter?</h3>
                        <p>If San Joaquin residents feel like their tap water is unsafe, does that mean that they’re turning to other resources for their drinking water? Water suppliers would need to know if their consumers are spending less on their water utilities because they think it’s unsafe. To answer this question, we can compare water quality perception of each county to the volume of water bottles purchased in a single year. What we’d expect is higher water quality perception means fewer water bottles purchased. </p>

                        <p>Here, we can say that this is the case, to a degree, but there is such a negligible negative relationship that many other factors probably drive people’s decision to purchase water bottles.</p>

                        <h3>How can we estimate perception?</h3>
                        <p>The question addressing perception of water quality was asked once as a rotating question in the American Housing Survey, and that is our only concrete hint as to what people are feeling about their water quality. More often than not, we don’t have this data. But it’s an important piece of data to monitor. One proxy through which cities can do so is search popularity.</p>
                        <img src="graphics/searches.png" class="graphic">
                        <p>This chart maps search popularity of water quality related terms, such as “water quality,” “drinking water,” and “water purification,” (from Google Trends) to our safety perception percentages for fourteen metro areas that cover California. The higher proportion of all searches a term takes up, the higher search popularity score it has. All counties fall within one of the metro areas.</p>
                        <p>Excluding the three metro areas on the left side of the chart (Medford-Klamath Falls, Reno, and El Centro), the more people search for water quality related terms, the more trust they have in their water quality. As for the three outliers, they are the metro areas with the lowest populations, and may be more heavily populated by rural residents, who tend to be more knowledgeable about their water and therefore have greater trust in their water quality (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4948862/" target="_blank">Dean</a>).</p>
                        <p>Cities can use this search popularity information to monitor how their residents perceive the quality of their water. Depending on whether or not that perception matches with the reality of the situation, they can then decide how to modify or improve related communication to address the discrepancy.</p>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>When asked about why he thinks his water is safe to drink, one of our interviewees was at a loss for words. He didn’t know. “Not having this information seems a little funny.” Currently, perception and reality don’t seem to match up, and this is often the fault of poor communication. It will never hurt to have increased trust, transparency, and knowledge about water quality, and tackling perception — or the inaccuracy of it — is the first step. </p>

                        <p><sup>1</sup> Based on data from the 2015 American Housing Survey (AHS), researchers at Amherst College and UCLA identified sociodemographic factors that influence individuals’ perception of tap water (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2017WR022186" target="_blank">Javidi</a>). The Census Bureau releases individual responses to the questionnaire, which contains multiple demographic factors and a yes or no question on whether a respondent thinks their tap water is safe. However, the dataset does not identify the county for each AHS respondent, so we instead developed our own model using this data for the water quality perception for each county in California. In this model, we essentially build “fake counties” by sampling responses in the survey so they match each county’s demographics that were shown in the report to influence an individual’s perception of water safety---things like ethnicity, homeownership, or education. The code for this model is included <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/stanford.edu/file/d/198s4eiHeAngQ2eHC6UGtnFs7OSo-c4cI/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. Here, water quality perception is based on these demographics. The results of this model could be improved in the future, since it is slow to converge and still has error remaining.</p>
                        <p><sup>2</sup> California Water Boards, 2017 Annual Compliance Report for Public Water Systems. This data set contains information about all reportable non-compliance events in a public water system, as well as the population served by the affected water system. % of population affected by at least one water quality violation was calculated by summing the total population served by each water system with at least one violation, divided by a county’s total population. Alpine County (pop. 1120) was removed, as the Annual Compliance Report indicates that the Bear Creek (pop. 290) water system serves 2650 individuals, suggesting that 237% of the population was affected. Note that this graph does not reflect water quality problems experienced by people served by private well or other non-public water system, as well as water quality issues or potential contaminants that do not fall under state reporting requirements. </p>
